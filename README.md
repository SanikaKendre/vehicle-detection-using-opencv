# vehicle-detection-using-opencv
In this project we detect and count vehicles on road using opencv and python
It detects HMV(Heavy motor vehicle) and LMv(Light motor vehicle) 
It uses cascade classifier for detection 
Traffic management has become an important daily routine in cities today with the exponential growth of traffic on roads. Automatic vehicle detection from traffic scenes and extracting essential parameters related to vehicular traffic can help better management of traffic on busy highways and road intersections. Monitoring traffic flow and estimating traffic parameters can be carried out using sensors [1, 2] as well as through image processing techniques.  With the advances in technology, monitoring traffic through image processing techniques yield a wide
Range of traffic parameters such as flow of traffic, speed of vehicles, number of vehicles, classification of vehicles, density of vehicles etc. Since the vehicles can be tracked over a selected segment of a roadway, rather than at a single point, it is possible to measure the “true” density of vehicles for each lane. Image processing techniques can also be applied to traffic video surveillance to detect the vehicles in motion, number plate identification, recognition of obstacles etc. Traffic monitoring through image processing techniques can lead to better control of the flow of traffic as well as to identification of reckless users and speed violators.
